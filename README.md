This Julia package implements Uniformly Accurate numerical methods (UA) for highly oscillating problems. We propose to solve the following equation:

$$\frac{d u(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} A u(t) + f(t, u(t)), \qquad u(t=t_{start})=u_{in}, \qquad \varepsilon \in ]0, 1],$$

with

$u : t \in [t_{start}, t_{end}] \mapsto u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n, t_{start}, t_{end} \in \mathbb{R}, \qquad u_{in}\in \mathbb{R}^n$, 

$A\in {\mathcal{M}}_{n,n}(\mathbb{R})\quad $ is such that $\quad \tau \mapsto e^{\tau A}$ is $2 \pi$-periodic,  $\quad f : (t, u) \in  \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$.

## Installation

HOODESolver.jl is a registered package and can be installed using the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, enter Pkg mode (by pressing `]`)

```julia
julia>]
(@v1.5) pkg> add HOODESolver
```

## Usage

The following is an example with the system of HÃ©non-Heiles. Please see the [documentation](https://pnavaro.github.io/HOODESolver.jl/stable/) for further usage, tutorials, and api reference.

```julia
using HOODESolver
using Plots

epsilon= 0.0001

A = [ 0 0 1 0 ; 
      0 0 0 0 ; 
     -1 0 0 0 ; 
      0 0 0 0 ]

f1 = LinearHOODEOperator( epsilon, A)

f2 = (u,p,t) ->  [ 0, u[4], 2*u[1]*u[2], -u[2] - u[1]^2 + u[2]^2 ] 

tspan = (0.0, 3.0)

u0 = [0.55, 0.12, 0.03, 0.89]
prob = SplitODEProblem(f1, f2, u0, tspan)
```

solve the defined problem

```julia
sol = solve(prob, HOODEAB()) 
plot(sol) 
```
